# COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING SCRIPTS

## Concept
1. Each problem has its own folder, which can contains files like: solution.cpp, checker.cpp, gen.cpp
2. Every configuration(include testcases) is stored in a single config.json file.
### Procedure to test a program
1. Compile every necessary file. (Only compile modified files).
2. Test the program in sample test case
3. Generate more tests
4. Test on newly generated tests.

### Task Configuration
There are 10 Configuration:
#### 1. Name
The name of the problem, usually the the name or id number.
#### 2. Group
The name of the contest, used for archive.

3. Is Interactive?
4. Use Local checker? 
5. Checker parameters
6. Use Generattion? 
7. Time Limit
8. Truncate Long Test?
9. Print only Wrong answer

### Archive Structure

### 
Start CC: Crtl + Alt + C
New Task: Ctrl + Alt + N
Archive: Ctrl + Alt + A
Test Configuration: Ctrl + Alt + E
Test Dialog: Ctrl + Alt + T
Complie and Run: Ctrl + Alt + B
Complie with terminal: Ctrl + Alt + Shift + B
Format Code: Ctrl + Alt + L

#### Verdic
1. AC
2. WA
3. TLE
4. RTE

# Fast printing?


# TODO
1. ~~Add option to compile code in terminal (With keyboard shortcut Crtl + Shift + Alt + B)~~
2. Implement interactor checker.
3. Silent testing (not print test)
4. Speed testing phase
5. ~~Slow solution in seperate file? (convenient for coding, but may reduce performance)~~
6. Rewrite script?
