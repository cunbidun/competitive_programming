	- ## Problem statement
		-
	- ## Observation
		- Assume that, there is a minimal subgraph that can generate all the combination of A and B. It's easy to see that all the vertexes in this graph are connected to at least one A vertex and one B vertex
		- So for all the vertexes that only connect to A or B vertex, we can safely remove it from the original graph
		- If the final graph is not empty, the answer is `Yes` else it's `No`
	- ## Solution
