- # Problem statement
	- There are $2N$ integers $A_1​,A_2​,...,A_{2N}$​ written on a blackboard, and an integer $M$ at least $2$.
	  Alice and Bob will play a game. They will alternately perform the following operation, with Alice going first, until there is no number on the blackboard.
		- Choose a number and delete it from the blackboard.
	- At the end of the game, if the sum of numbers deleted by Alice modulo $M$ equals the sum of numbers deleted by Bob modulo $M$, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.
	  Which player will win if both plays optimally?
